## Development

Requires [Icon Composer](https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/) to be installed under `/Applications`

```sh
make # export all of the targets below
make ios # export icon for ios
make macos # export icon for macos
make watchos # export icon for watchos
make clean # delete exports
```

As far as I can tell the macOS and iOS exports are both identical but both targets are included for posterity.
